# Valorant Status Changer
This is a program which can make you appear offline to your friends in Valorant!

You can download the compiled executable from https://github.com/3u4/valorant-status-changer/raw/main/Compiled%20.exe/Valorant%20Status%20Changer.exe.

## How does this work?
- Valorant Status Changer adds a firewall rule to block the TCP port 5223 because of which Valorant shows you as Offline. You can still play the game without any issues but your team text chat, parties, friend list, etc. wont work until you press the Appear Online button.

## Can this get me banned?
- No you won't get banned for using this as this doesn't modify anything in the game it just adds a simple firewall rule in Windows.
